      ======================================================================
      - REP 119 : Rgb camera link relative to the Base link 
      ====================================================================== 
      Base link is currently defined as the rotational centre on the bottom
      of the base mould. For both create and kobuki this is actually exactly
      the same 3d world point. 

      This may cause an issue with a base with much different floor clearance.
      Should we be using base_footprint for this specification instead?

      Note: REP needs to be updated with the information below 
      (currently in development and awaiting feedback)

   <!-- This is how far forward or backward on the robot the camera is set. -->
       <!-- Test this by setting the robot's axles exactly 1 meter from a wall, start up RVIZ with the robot at 0,0,0 on the grid, -->
       <!-- and see if the wall lines up with the first 1 meter grid line from the robot. -->

    <!--   <xacro:property name="cam_py" value="-0.0125" /> Y varies for different configurations. This is set in sensors_urdf -->

    <!-- This is the height of the camera. It isn't as essential as most settings, because we are using a "2D" map. -->
    <!-- However, setting it accurately can help with some use cases. -->
    <xacro:property name="cam_pz" value="0.025" />

    <!-- This is the tilt across the horizontal when looking straight at the camera. Probably important, but hard to see if it is.
